# What is DisTab?
DisTab is a pastime project of some random school kid.

For their story, let's call them Bob. Bob was a school kid, who was curious about frontend web developement, and thereby began their journey to learning HTML, CSS, and JS. At the same time, they wanted something that would actually prove useful, while also being easy to make. That's when DisTab was born. DisTab began as just a sidebar with a few buttons, and quickly, Bob learnt animations and CSS styling to improve the looks of their creation. As the day ended, Bob realised that they had made a lot of changes in simply one day, and wanted a way to document their progress. That's when they turned to GitHub, a place where they could upload their work and tweak it, publishing new releases as time went on. Bob is still new to these things, so please be friendly to Bob :)
